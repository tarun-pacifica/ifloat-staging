      <h2>How to Find Products</h2>
      <h3>3 Ways to Start</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Find Box - just type in a few relevant words</li>
        <li>The Tag Cloud - larger words mean more products</li>
        <li>Show All Categories - browse all products hierarchically</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Customized Filtering</h3>
      <p>Having used the find box or selected a tag, you can narrow down your results quickly and easily using the powerful filtering tools. Want all the size 9, deck shoes? Or how about all the tins of antifouling between 25 and 85 US fluid ounces that can be applied with a roller? It's all just a click away.</p>
      <p>The ifloat<sup>速</sup> difference is that we never prejudge which aspects of a product will be most important to you.</p>
